                <h4> I’m takin’ notes from every book I’m readin’</h4>
                <h4> I didn’t know the word “no” could be so freein’</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Sooner or later, the world of hip-hop needs to have a conversation about the Islington rapper, Little Simz. Not just the world of UK hip-hop or the world of hip-hop made by women, but everyone needs to give Simz her flowers. Simz has reached the point where you cannot objectively say that she is not good. She has proved this with her surprise fifth studio album drop coming off the back of her Mercury Prize It is interesting that as majestic as SIMBI was, Little Simz was clearly not trying to top it, in terms of splendor, as most fans would usually expect from an artist. The album was announced a week before its release and featured no lead singles, however, the announcement gave us an idea of what to anticipate. </p>
                <br>
                <h4> emotion is energy in motion</h4>
                <h4> honour your truth and feelings</h4>
                <h4> eradicate fear</h4>
                <h4> boundaries are important</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Track 1- Angel</p>
                <br>
                <h4> Never cared ‘bout bein’ immortalised</h4>
                <h4> How can I stand with the opps and not with the tribe? </h4>
                <br>
                <p>Right off the bat, we can tell the approach Simz is taking on this opening song and most of what I had expected from the quote in the announcement is proved right. Introvert from SIMBI, has a call to arms feel. Offence and Persons(the first track on Grey Area and A Curious Tale of Trials+Persons respectively) both have an “It’s time to begin” feeling to them in different regards. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Angel begins with a cool melody over drums, but similar to the aforementioned intro songs, Simz goes straight into the themes she plans to explore on the project — growth, introspection, labels and the struggles of a modern day artist —in this nearly six minute opening. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Simz maintains her cadence as she provides carefully thought out bars and word choices, and Cleo Sol gives listeners the clean vocals that complement Simz very well. A great introduction to this body of work. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Track 2- Gorilla</p>
                <br>
                <h4> Sim Simma, who got the keys to my Bloodclaat bimmer? </h4>
                <h4> Big time driller, monkey to gorilla</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Opening the second cut with magnificent trumpets followed by the bouncy beat, Little Simz gifts us a braggadocios track littered with clever one liners and crisp rhyming patterns. In some ways similar to Boss, from Grey Area, Gorilla’s lively bars and punchy instrumentals are a testament to how naturally hip-hop seems to come to Little Simz. </p>
                <br>
                <h4> Introvert, but she ain’t timid</h4>
                <br>
                <p>If there was ever a need to prove that Little Simz is still one of the coldest spitters in the game, outside of the many tracks before this, Gorilla is your go to song on this album. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Track 3- Silhouette</p>
                <br>
                <h4> When the drums speak to me, I just breathe through it</h4>
                <h4> Cool with a little flare, how does she do it? </h4>
                <br>
                <p>On track three, Little Simz really opens fire with her thoughts in relation to the themes that this project is exploring. She addresses her issues with people trying to control her actions and decisions as an artist over a more distinct and liberated instrumental than Angel had. I can only assume that the song is a kind of message to labels or people who she believes are trying to hold her down, and a medium for opening up about feeling betrayed by somebody that she trusted. </p>
                <br>
                <h4> I don’t wanna live my life bein’ a silhouette</h4>
                <br>
                <p>She closes her final verse out with the statement above and this can be interpreted as her not wanting to become merely a shape that represents her real self, ie. a silhouette. The production runs free on the tail end of this six and a half minute song. Also worth mentioning, Cleo Sol returns on this cut to accompany Simz’s bars once again. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Track 4- No Merci</p>
                <br>
                <h4> Bet you wanna see a Black woman get active</h4>
                <h4> Whenever they chat shit, I just say nada</h4>
                <br>
                <p>The immediate reaction to track 4 is the double entendre on the title of the track(how it sounds as an english statement) as well as the title of the project itself(when translating this track’s title into English). She explores feeling almost held down in her career by certain things, and certain decisions she almost took in her earlier years. She specifically talks about contract signings and how they try to trick you into making a career altering decision such as signing to a label, among other things. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The song features a quite laid back instrumental and considering the content that Simz wishes to explore, it’s almost as if she is proving to whoever the song is directed at that she is in a much better place mentally than she was or would’ve been with them. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Track 5-X</p>
                <br>
                <h4> Why does my Blackness have to come with a fight now? </h4>
                <h4> I’m peaceful at heart, but I suggest you pipe down</h4>
                <br>
                <p>At the midpoint of this project, we have one of the most intense listens. Little Simz is an experienced black artist. In being that, she has tackled issues of race and gender in the past. Whenever she explores the topic of race, gender, immigration, etc. in her songs, she delivers the most profound verses and draws for the most moving production. The beat here has that familiar ‘call to arms’ feel to it as she talks about what being black in today’s world looks like to her. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Although the previous cuts are fantastic, each doing what they had to, this one brings that relatability that a lot of black people seek in the music that we listen to. From workplace troubles to fighting with history, the hook rings out “I need you, Lord”. This follows, as a lot of the orchestral melodies have spiritual or religious words. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Track 6- Heart on Fire</p>
                <br>
                <h4> Devil works hard, but the business works harder</h4>
                <h4> I vowed from now to work smarter</h4>
                <br>
                <p>The sixth piece on this body of work has the melancholic vibe that we are used to hearing from Little Simz. A very fitting sound considering the topics she speaks on in this song. Following themes such as distrust on this song and further exploring self-discovery in her life and career, Simz takes us on this four minute voyage, and her relatability endures. </p>
                <br>
                <p>In the second verse, she talks about feeling lost and forgetting why you even started something in the first place, maintaining her relatability. The content of this song was definitely going to make it a hard, deep and heartfelt listen but intelligently, the production makes it smoother and more digestible to the listener. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Track 7- Broken</p>
                <br>
                <h4> You never been to that place you envision</h4>
                <h4> Sky gave you limits you had no choice but to accept</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Broken is the longest song on the project at seven and a half minutes long, so you know it is going to be a heavy listen. This track features a culmination of many of the major themes on the album as Simz delves into mental health issues in the black community. </p>
                <br>
                <p>She approaches this topic in many different ways and it is so easy to get drawn into what she is saying and to immerse yourself in the message she is bringing across because of her lucidity. The delivery and cadence so far have been immaculate, and that remains true on this song. Because of its content, this was easily going to be the most emotionally and mentally striking song on this project but Simz does a good job of following through with her superb word choice and flow. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Track 8- Sideways</p>
                <br>
                <h4> They say Black don’t crack</h4>
                <h4> My complexion is iridescent</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Every project has the point at which a certain cut seems to be allowing the album to catch its breath. This is not always a change in quality, but in good bodies of work, usually rather a change in pacing and content. After a song as heavy as Broken, it seems to me that Simz is slowing down with the shortest song on here at a bit over two minutes. The production on this felt a little boxed-in though after so many dynamic beats prior. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Little Simz, however, continues to stay true to the substance of the project and goes on to explain how and why she won’t let herself get walked all over with introspective word choices and clever bars. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Track 9- Who Even Cares</p>
                <br>
                <h4> In this rat race, we all gotta get it somehow</h4>
                <h4> Can’t worry about the others now</h4>
                <br>
                <p>On this song we realize, just in time for the outro, that the album actually isn’t catching its breath, but rather slowly coming to a smooth and deserved end. With the slushy autotune production, Simz prepares the listeners for the final lap of what has been an intimate, personal and powerful journey. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Discussing how important it is to take one’s time in making decisions, Simz allows for the listener to fully commit to finishing the experience and calls on Cleo Sol’s soulful voice one last time on this song. Initially, I had wished for a longer tracklist but on track number 9 on this fifty minute listen, I can say that Simz put the songs together beautifully and presented them as a journey. All great journeys must come to an end after all the highs and lows. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Track 10-Control</p>
                <br>
                <h4> Lookin’ through a wabi-sabi lens so I get a wabi-sabi view</h4>
                <br>
                <h4> I don’t wanna hear bad news</h4>
                <br>
                <p>The excerpt above is a very interesting one because of the use of “wabi-sabi”. This is a Japanese concept about the search for beauty in imperfection and accepting the natural cycle of life. A reminder that all things are impermanent. While discussing trauma on this final piece of the puzzle, Simz slips in this concept as if to explain the album ending. All things, and by extension, all good things must come to an end. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Here we are at the conclusion of this fantastic project listening to a powerful voice on the intro and the chorus, and ever-clever bars from Little Simz about trauma as the curtain closes. A neat finish from Little Simz on what has been a voyage through the depths of life and what it means to live for a lot of people. </p>
                <br>

                <br>
                <p>When I listen to rap from the UK, I am able to enjoy it(being an enthusiast) but, objectively speaking, some songs and projects are made in a certain way that keeps the music within the borders of the UK. There isn’t anything exactly wrong with that. They are “sticking to their roots” and getting better at what they are good at. The way I see it, in music, the biggest songs are either catchy in some regard, or they are relatable. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Artists in the UK seem to take pride in a more “cult” following where they can rap about what they really want to, than becoming “mainstream” and having to make a specific kind of music. This could also be due to the fact that many of them have origins in grime, and grime musicians mostly remained underground. Simz is no different from these other artists though, but the way I see it, Simz is doing what she is good at. And that is pure hip-hop, that can be enjoyed all over the world because it is intentional in its content and masterful in its expression. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Simz has never been a stranger to drilling into pressing social issues in her rap, especially when she ties her experiences into the songs. Although, she can definitely hit with the witty bars and big-boss flow, I think Simz is at her best when she is focused on expressing her views on a topic. That is why I believe this album is so well-worked. On each song(except Gorilla, which had it’s own agenda), Simz came with topics that are relatable to so many of her fans — growth, distrust, feeling held down, almost making bad decisions, having to stand up for yourself, and race and gender. These themes are very neatly woven in-and-out of each song on the project. The last two I mentioned, however, not only tie into the other cuts, but also connect this project to Sometimes I Might Be Introvert. </p>
                <br>
                <p>In my opinion, Little Simz was two for two in her last two albums Grey Area and SIMBI, and in adding this incredible body of work to her catalogue, she is currently the UK’s number one quality hip-hop export, in my not so humble opinion. I hope that this stellar run does not come to an end anytime soon. I look forward to more work from Little Simz, which can only further her growth and offer fans one exceptional listening experience after the other.winning fourth album, Sometimes I Might Be Introvert, from 2021. </p>
