<h4> So what should we do next?</h4><br>

<p>Kojey Radical is what I would describe as a genre bender. He is in fact, an artist that expresses everything I love about the UK scene. Smooth, silky, divergent, expressive, clever and powerful.
Short backstory: My exploration of the UK rap scene began in 2017, with an online discovery of grime acts. The sounds were mixed(sometimes almost discombobulated) and very different. I took one sip of the UK rap juice, and I never put the cup down.</p> <br>

<p>In this age of generic rap beats, overused drill patterns and tired hip-hop drums, an album like “Reason to Smile” presents 2022’s breath of fresh air grounded in the need to make a statement of black British excellence. A feat that Islington rapper, Little Simz, received plaudits for in 2021 with her fourth studio album, “Sometimes I might be Introvert”. The unwavering musicality coupled with a revolutionary tone in the rap gives me so much to say about my personal 2022 album of the year. Literally coming off his resounding EP, “Cashmere Tears”, “Reason to Smile” opens with last words on “Cashmere Tears” as he takes us on a journey of love and life. </p><br>
<br><p>Track 1- Reason to Smile(ft. Tiana Major9) </p><br>

<h4>This cashmere feel amazing, I’m back baby </h4><br>

<p>With about ten years of experience in his craft on his back, we enter a new world. A different space. The album opens with a woman’s response to the question “So what should we do next?”, in a Ghanaian local dialect, Twi. On his EP, “23Winters”, he delves into issues concerning the African diaspora and family. It’s not surprising then that he would begin his debut LP with words that would invoke a feeling of home to him, as he is of Ghanaian heritage.</p<<br>

<p>The 3-minute intro really feels like a majestic entrance from start to finish. With the anticipation steadily building, Kojey Radical’s indubitable voice touches the beat. Delivering with his usual cadence, he keeps the excitement growing. The song reaches its peak when the vocals of the soulful London born singer, Tiana Major9 meet the grand instrumentals on the hook. </p><br>



<h4> Felt ten pounds lighter when I let go of my fears</h4><br>

<p>The intro has a driven and grateful feeling to it, and Kojey Radical meets the track head on with his lyrics. From start to finish, the song is a feel good sound, a sound that will keep you excited about what is left to expect. An excellent intro.</p><br>


<p>Track 2- Together </p>


<h4> Carved my name in a stone and flint</h4><br>

<p>The album gets revving, and the second cut introduces the funky touch, which turns out to be a running sound on the project. Impeccable flow and clarity, compelling lyricism and the conviction that his musical ability is unmatched in the scene. The smooth execution of the addition of funk components shows Kojey Radical’s brilliant understanding of musicality. As I listened, I just couldn’t help but imagine the song with a live band.</p><br>

<p>“Together” is a reintroduction to Kojey Radical’s wordplay. His roots in spoken word are always evident with his delivery but on the previous cut, he was really just getting us to the melodiousness of the project. This is a project meant to dazzle and be positively different and that’s exactly what “Together” brings.</p><br>

<h4>Seen many come and go, no, many changes</h4>
<h4>Had them take good notes down, down, pages</h4><br>

<p>Presenting, with undisputed conviction, and his usual casual flex with metaphors in a way that is akin to riddling, Kojey Radical conveys the path he has taken with this album through this funky second cut, flowing into the next song with a conversation with his mother about what raising Kojey was like. </p><br>

<p>Track 3- Nappy</p><br>

<h4> I been on a mountain</h4>
<h4> Growin’ my hair and findin’ my powers</h4><br>

<p>The frisky funky trajectory continues but this track proceeds with an aura of subdued caution, in a matter that’s meant to say, “Don’t forget, I’m still Kojey and here’s a reminder of my ability”. By this point, the first two songs are enough proof that sonically the project has gone in with everything. This song is enough confirmation that there is a whole lot being said on the project but it has been curated in a way to make it more digestible to the listener.. </p><br>


<h4> Maybe my hair too nappy, my lips too big</h4>
<h4> My nose too wide, my dick too big</h4><br>

<p>After taking in the immaculate flow over that fantastic beat and loving this cut, you could sit down and pay great attention to what he was saying. You’d ask yourself “What is he saying on the hook?”, “Why did he say it that way and in that order?”. I see this song as a statement of embracing the black skin and the features and stigma and/or stereotypes that come with it. The effortless manner with which Kojey seems to present his thoughts on this cut, puts up the adored Kojey banner as we get into the second feature on the project.. </p><br>


<p>Track 4- Silk(ft. Masego)</p><br>

<h4> Someone said I’m underrated, that was news to me</h4>
<h4> ’Cause the fam’ eat good and sleep beautifully</h4><br>

<p>From my information about this song, Kojey’s verses were actually from freestyles on an instagram live. The Hoxton rapper got in full swagger mode, displaying his rap firepower over the jazzy beat. On the project so far, Kojey took one look at his crossroads and picked the path labelled “jazz, funky and soulful” instead of “overbearing, aggressive and pacey”. And he has smashed it so far. <br>

The genre-blending soulful vocals of the Kingston born sensation, Masego, on the chorus and on his verse are stellar. He talks himself up and talks about past rejections for partnership deals, and touches up some aspects of London life that he enjoys: women and the thrift stores. Keeping his voice silky, no pun intended, Masego pushes this track further up on my ranking of the cuts from the project than it would be if this were only Kojey on the song, and the project has had no misses so far.</p><br>


<p>Track 5- Pressure(ft. Shaé Universe)</p><br>

<h4> Keep your heart cold, play your part</h4>
<h4> Even when it’s hard, don’t let ’em take yo’ heart from you</h4><br>

<p>This song is a very interesting one. For an artiste like Kojey Radical, who makes his music in a very unique and specific fashion, it’s always interesting to see his music become a widely appreciated sound. And when it happens in this manner, the fans bend to you and not the other way around. After amassing a large following like he has right now, the question becomes how to handle it. Kojey addresses his insecurities about this on the fifth cut on this project and works his way through his growth as an artiste and some personal milestones. 
 </p><br>




<h4> In 2017, I had a five-figure debt</h4>
<h4> In 2018, I had to find my respect</h4><br>

<p>Rapping with a wholesome cadence, Kojey could easily be encouraging himself with this song. Shaé Universe asks the questions. With her sleek vocals, she asks questions that all artistes can relate to. Upcoming and established. Here we get a sense of the poet and speaker that Kojey Radical is. </p><br>

<p>Track 6- Born(ft. Cashh)</p><br>

<h4>We only countin’ summers in the city that I’m from</h4><br>

<p>From the bright and colorful first four songs, the album seems to be catching its breath. This song maintains the smooth, soulful and jazzy components that were laced in the first few songs, but adds a cool factor to it in some kind of musical alloy of afroswing, which is a mixture of genres in itself, and jazz and soul. </p><br>

<p>Cashh’s silky vocals nudge the song and put the Caribbean feel on the song, while the beat still maintains the afrobeat pattern. Kojey goes retrospective with his lyrics, similar to “Pressure”. But in the same way, different. As “Pressure” could also be seen as more introspective than retrospective. Cashh also delivers some bars discussing his detainment by the immigration and the struggles of trying to be a different person when you’re well known where you’re from. Considering that he had been deported from the UK in 2014, he would definitely have been trying to adjust and on his return it’s a great collaboration and a solid song on the album. </p><br>

<p>Track 7- Pusher Man: BWI</p><br>

<h4>This room got elephants in it, tough crowd, long day</h4>
<h4>Can’t please everybody, can’t trust anybody</h4><br>

<p>On this song, Kojey Radical expresses and discusses a trait that is required by an artiste like himself: awareness, especially as a black artiste. Kojey Radical, like best artistes the UK scene has to offer, is very intentional in the kind of music he makes and what he portrays in his art, and he displays this masterfully on “Pusher Man: BWI”. The track itself being in two parts represents this. The first part is an expression of the feeling of success. Once you get a taste of it, you always want to do more. In an industry where drugs, violence, and sex are central topics and are basically promoted, it reaches a point where you come to terms with the reality. </p><br>

<h4>They like you better when you sell a bit</h4>
<h4>You ain’t a bust if you ain’t never got your hands dirty</h4><br>

<p>Kojey Radical’s cognizance is very telling of the kind of person he is and it is also portrayed in the music he makes. In this song he uses intricate wordplay and clever double entendres to discuss success in the industry and what it takes to keep that success. An amazing piece of musical and lyrical brilliance from Kojey. </p><br>

<p>Track 8- Talkin(ft. Kelis & Tiana Major9) </p><br>

<h4>Big black man from Ghana</h4>
<h4>Step forward like I’m Nkrumah</h4><br>

<p>After proving that his flair is a choice, Kojey rolls out a smooth, yet looming song. The song is essentially the “call to arms” sound that a project of this calibre was begging for. With the sumptuous vocals of Kelis and Tiana Major 9 preceding his verses, Kojey brought his assertive tone and confident cadence back. </p><br>

<h4>This ain’t no red or the blue pill thing ’cause their agents can’t get near me</h4><br>

<p>This song is hard-hitting. From the chorus, to Kojey’s verses, to the production. The song just wakes you up. And it is not out of place in the least bit. The song closes out with the words of Kojey’s mother setting the tone for the next track, and the project maintains its flow. </p><br>

<p>Track 9- War Outside(feat. Lex Amor) </p><br>

<h4>Damned if I do, cancelled if I don’t</h4>
<h4>Either way, I’m wrong, I’m just tryna get this weight off me</h4><br>

<p>With Kojey Radical’s mother concluding the last song by expressing some of her fears whenever her kids were outside the house, she starts painting the picture of probably the most popular song on the album(because of its inclusion in the FIFA 22 soundtrack). Outside of its popularity, the song fits perfectly with the themes on the project. Going back to Kojey’s awareness, the lyrics of the song display that trait very well again. I listened to an interview involving a legendary UK musician and he pointed out the fact that when people grow up in certain situations, they normalize some traumatic experiences. </p><br>

<h4>There’s a war goin’ on outside</h4>
<h4>Nobody see it but me (But me) </h4><br>

<p>When I listen to the song, I interpret it as Kojey expressing his awareness of the situation around, but unfortunately, it has been normalized by a lot of people. But he’s making a point that he sees what’s going on and he understands that that’s not how it’s supposed to be. Lex Amor neatly emphasizes this on her shared verse with Kojey. Both artistes, flow beautifully on the groovy beat. This song is a big one for Kojey and rightly so. </p><br>

<p>Track 10- Payback(ft. Knucks) </p><br>

<h4>Count my money up, I need my racks</h4>
<h4>Sellin’ a dream, but I’ma need that back</h4><br>

<p>This is easily my favorite song on the album. This song sums up the album completely, and it is probably my favorite rap song I have heard this year. The beat is so infectious and the hook does just that and draws you into the groovy world of “Reason to Smile”, where we make statement after statement. </p><br>

<h4>Twenty seconds to go, so solid</h4>
<h4>Or was it twenty-one? Forgive me, I was young</h4><br>

<p>Knucks, much like Kojey Radical, is so refreshing to listen to and the manner in which he began his verse, made me do what I always do when I’m loving a song, and I took it right back to the top. His verse is a mix of elegance and bravado and he sits perfectly on the beat. </p><br>

<h4>Rap my freedom like a gift, and I ain’t seen the trap since</h4>
<h4>Long day, no sleep, I was doin’ mad trips</h4><br>

<p>The wordplay and cadence is immaculate on Kojey’s verse, and I love that the rap quality doesn’t drop on the distinct production. It’s easy to get lost in the production but both artistes successfully project their verses. It has been an incredible journey on the project so far. </p><br>

<p>Track 11- Fubu</p><br>

<h4>I-I-I think my neighbours think I’m selling drugs, still they show me love</h4>
<h4>’Cause it’d probably make them cooler if they think that I’m a thug</h4><br>

<p>After Payback, Kojey lets the album breathe again with smooth and toned production on “Fubu”. The verses from Kojey are right on the mark. Kojey Radical is an artiste who I believe has mastered what he does on his verses. His delivery and wordplay, along with his content, have been on a hundred throughout this project. The beautiful thing is the dynamic presentation of every message on each song. </p><br>

<p>In his flows, and the feelings he clearly seeks to evoke in the listener, Kojey is very particular in how he presents his craft. The soothing chords on “Fubu” already set the tone for a calming track and Kojey hits it on the head. </p><br>

<p>Track 12- Beautiful(ft. Wretch 32 & Shakka) </p><br>

<h4>We can make a perfect storm if the weather nice</h4>
<h4>I could love you in a bonnet ’cause your lovin’ nice</h4><br>

<p>Following in the same energy as “Fubu”, Kojey Radical effortlessly presents “Beautiful”. The sublime voice of the smooth vocalist, Shakka, after Kojey calmly concludes his verse are effective on the hook in drawing out the listener’s “feels”. It’s really just one of those songs for the vibes. </p><br>

<p>You usually don’t know what version of Wretch 32 you’re going to get, but Shakka’s vocals and Kojey’s verse set the mood, and it would be unlike Wretch to be out of bounds with his delivery and content. An MC of his calibre easily bodies this tune, and that’s exactly what he does. All round, one of my favorites on the album. </p><br>

<p>Track 13-Anywhere(ft. Ego Ella May) </p><br>

<h4>I have been in a daze</h4>
<h4>Come take me away</h4>
<h4>Come take me</h4><br>

<p>You can feel the project starting to wind down for the conclusion. Things start slowing down and when you have back to back love songs, it just feels like less obvious. The listeners can just vibe and feel every aspect of the songs. Production, melodies, vocals, quotable lyrics. </p><br>

<h4>Maybe I would never understand this, we should start a home and not a family</h4><br>

<p>Another concept that I feel when I listen to this project is growth. In addition to the awareness, Kojey has show a great amount of growth from “Cashmere Tears” to be able to make a project like this. </p><br>

<p>Track 14- Solo(ft. Rexx Life Raj) </p><br>

<h4>I’ll wear that smile, I’ll be okay</h4><br>

<p>Feeling more like a conversation than a song, this is where the project really feels like it’s coming to an end. In a fifteen lap run, you go as steady as you can, and go extra hard in some instances to take the pace up a notch then slow down a bit to catch your breath, and before the last lap, you make sure you’re in a good position to take it all the way. </p><br>

<p>That’s what Kojey and Rexx Life Raj have done with this song. Kojey’s flow is perfect and the vocals of Rexx cut through the production like a hot knife through butter. Discussing their mental states as artistes and role models, they also divulge how they convince themselves that everything will be good. Ending the song with those compelling words, Kojey prepares to put the last flower in this beautifully wrapped bouquet. </p><br>

<p>Track 15- Gangsta</p><br>


<h4>Think my daddy still in love with her, but not in love with love</h4><br>

<p>Songs about family, especially parents, are always interesting to ponder about. With the words Kojey closed out the “Solo” with, I could easily wonder why he didn't write a song about his father instead or the men in his life? Maybe words about his mother would be easier to articulate, maybe he wanted to end the project on the same grateful tone he started out with, or maybe he really just made the song with the intention of making a song for his mother. It wouldn’t be a stretch. She has literally been on the project. </p><br>

<h4>Wrote a book and raised a king</h4><br>

<p>This is a song for his mother that could easily resonate with a lot of people who grew up with their mothers, whether their fathers were present or not. It’s always a great feeling when an artiste openly expresses gratitude to someone and it feels very wholesome when it’s a parent. As the album draws its curtains, the listener will leave feeling fulfilled. Nothing says, “The End of Something Beautiful” more than an instrumental interlude. With the words his mother spoke at the end expressing how proud she is of Kojey, the project just feels complete and even more importantly, it feels successful. </p><br>

— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —

<p>Kojey Radical is a fantastic artiste, and after presenting this beautiful body of work, I can only hope that his art grows, and that he masters his craft even more. This project is a representation of what it means to be an artiste like Kojey with so much experience in honing his craft and such a clear understanding of what of kind music he wants to put forth. I pray he continues on this trajectory, because I love what he has shown on this project. </p><br>

<p>Best way to put it: carefully orchestrated and articulated brilliance. </p>
