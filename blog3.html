            <p class="title-text">
                <p>Fear is an unpleasant emotion caused by the threat of danger, pain, or harm. However, with the fear of failure, the threat isn’t caused by pain, or even harm, but mostly by shame. Yes, you can be afraid of being ashamed. You can be ashamed of your ego being hit, or your pride being affected. Yes it’s all possible. Kakorrhaphiophobia is the fear of failure, mostly extreme. I once had this fear of failure which germinated around grade 9 and persisted into my freshman year in High school (Presbyterian Boys’ Secondary School). Let me take you down memory lane. </p>
                <br><p>It was time for student elections in my basic school (Falsyd Foundation), and everyone was excited. I was in grade 9 at the time, which meant I was eligible to stand for any position. I was a very introverted person, so I thought I could not run for School Prefect. I intended to run for Disciplinary Prefect, since that area will have a less contest than the ultimate office. My English teacher, however had other plans for me. I was part of the smart ones in class, so he thought I deserved to contest in the grand office, a stereotype I didn’t agree with. I reluctantly budged and decided to contest for School Prefectship. I campaigned and did everything an aspirant would do. The Election Day came and although I didn’t think I’d win, I expected an honorable votes cast in my name. Oh my word, the results were declared and I think I had paraplegia. I felt so numb and disgraced. 15 percent of the votes made me feel like a loser. I decided not to participate in anything political from that day onwards. </p>
                <br><p>I tried to bury my past and move on. High school brought a fresh start and I thanked the heavens for that. I’d suffered from failure before, so I began to slowly grow a fear from it. I didn’t realise at the time, but from being afraid of answering questions in class, to being ashamed to join study groups, I was showing signs of fear of failure. “What if I miss the questions in class? What if I can’t answer a question in a study group?” My thoughts grew bigger as the days went by. The National Science and Math Quiz is the greatest quiz competition in Ghana, and every year, each high school wants to participate and win in order to have the bragging rights of being the best school in Ghana. My high School, Presby Boys’ had the most wins and wanted to maintain this great feat. As such, every student wants to join the school’s quiz team and help the school lift the coveted trophy. Initially my fear of not succeeding quenched the urge for me to write the quiz team entrance exam, but, once again, persuasions from friends and teachers made me budge and write the test. I failed to make the final cut and this worsened my woes. At this point, my fear of failure had grown into kakorrhaphiophobia. I didn’t want to try anything at all, after all, “I’d fail at it”, I thought. I even became afraid of exams, so I decided not to learn for it. I became mute in class and didn’t join any club. All this was in my first year in high school. </p>
                <br><p>As fate would have it, my canon event would be on one Friday, the 13th, surprisingly. I read a quote from the 26th president of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, which read, “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” This quote changed my life, literally. My perspectives and understanding of success changed greatly. I began to see failure as an avenue to refine you. I began to see myself as the man who is actually in the arena, the controller of my destiny. I began to use my fear of failure to overcome failure. I thought “if I’m afraid of failing at anything, then why shouldn’t I use that as a fuel to do my level best and prepare so well for that thing in order not to fail.” My Eureka moment had occurred. I changed my ways and started answering questions in class, joined various clubs of my interest and joined study groups. </p>
                <br><p>The Sharks Quiz competition was a young quiz competition in its third year. I had joined the sharks club in our school, and I wanted to join the team who would contest for the school. Applying my new theory on the fear of failure, I studied relentlessly and prepared aptly for the selection tests. I blitzed my way into the team and represented my school for the quiz as an English contestant. We won and all my efforts had been crowned. I thought to myself, “Maybe the fear of failure is a good thing”.     </p>

            <p class="post-description">“A butterfly in The Amazon forest flaps its wings and causes an earthquake in Syria.” I laughed at this tweet and deemed it as misinformation. After reading on the butterfly effect, I began to appreciate what that tweet meant. The person meant to highlight a theory which seems to suggest that a little occurrence can cause a huge effect at another place.</p>
